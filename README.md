Tangent Web Services Interview Assignment

KNOWN ISSUES

Web app has to run on a HTTP server and not on a HTTPS.
Still looking for a solution to this.
API refuses to accept non secure crosdomain requests, just returns: ERR: Connection refused.

AngularJS script still needs to be ammended for mobile platforms. The normal Bootstrap menu setup got interupted when using AngularJS.

Need more scale ability for the positions on the dashboard.
Currently there is no provision for additional positions created within the API.
The app should automatically scale for additional positions.

INSTRUCTIONS:

The app is created to be a self contained service and can be run directly on any domain or from a sub directory within a domain.
Just download and keep the structure intact.
